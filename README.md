This is the demo code for our USENIX Security 22 paper [ML-Doctor: Holistic Risk Assessment of Inference Attacks Against Machine Learning Models](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/liu-yugeng)

Please find the updated version in our lab's [repo](https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/ML-Doctor)

## Building Datasets
We prefer the users could provide the dataloader by themselves. But we show the demo dataloader in the code. Due to the size of the dataset, we won't upload it to github.

For UTKFace, we have two folders downloaded from [official website](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) in the UTKFace folder. The first is the "processed" folder which contains three landmark_list files(also can be downloaded from the official website). It is used to get the image name in a fast way because all the features of the images can be achieved from the file names. The second folder is the "raw" folder, which contains all the aligned and cropped images. 

For CelebA dataset, we have one folder and three files in the "celeba" folder. For the "img_celeba" folder, it contains all the images downloaded from the [official website](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and we align and crop them by ourselves. The others are three files used to get the attributes or file names, named "identity_CelebA.txt", "list_attr_celeba.txt", and "list_eval_partition.txt". The crop center is \[89, 121\] but it is ok if the users wouldn't like to crop it because we have resize function in the transforms so that it will not affect the input shapes.

For FMNIST and STL10, PyTorch has offered the datasets and they can be easily employed.

## Preparing
Users should install Python3 and PyTorch at first. If you want to train differential privacy shadow models, you should also install [opacus](https://github.com/pytorch/opacus). We recommend using conda to install it based on the official documents.

Or directly run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

## Testing
```python demo.py --attack_type X --dataset_name Y```

<table><tbody>
<!-- TABLE BODY -->
<tr>
<td align="center">Attack Type</td>
<td align="center">0</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Name</td>
<td align="center">MemInf</td>
<td align="center">ModInv</td>
<td align="center">AttrInf</td>
<td align="center">ModSteal</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

For dataset name, there are 4 datasets in the code, namely CelebA, FMNIST (Fashion-MNIST), STL10, and UTKFace.

For AttrInf, users should provide two attributes in the command line with the format "X_Y" and only CelebA and UTKface contain 2 attributes, e.g. 
```python demo.py --attack_type 2 --dataset_name UTKFace --attributes race_gender```

### For MemInf
We have four modes in this function
<table><tbody>
<!-- TABLE BODY -->
<tr>
<td align="center">Mode</td>
<td align="center">0</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Name</td>
<td align="center">BlackBox Shadow</td>
<td align="center">BlackBox Partial</td>
<td align="center">WhiteBox Partial</td>
<td align="center">WhiteBox Shadow</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

#### When buliding attack dataset
When using mode 0 and mode 3, i.e. having shadow models, users should choose [```get_attack_dataset_with_shadow```](./doctor/meminf.py#L699) function.
For the others (mode 1 and mode 2), it should be [```get_attack_dataset_without_shadow```](./doctor/meminf.py#L673) function.

#### When choosing attack model
When using mode 0, ```attack_model``` should be [```ShadowAttackModel```](./utils/define_models.py#L15), while [```PartialAttackModel```](./utils/define_models.py#L56) is  ```attack_model``` for mode 1 in blackbox.
As for whitebox (mode 2 and mode 3), users need to change ```attack_model``` to [```WhiteBoxAttackModel```](./utils/define_models.py#L97).
Users can also define attack models by themselves so we didn't fix the models here.

Note: we have the same [```ShadowAttackModel```](./utils/define_models.py#L15) and [```PartialAttackModel```](./utils/define_models.py#L56) in the code.

### For ModInv
For Secret Revealer method, users should pre-train an evaluation model with ResNet18 architecture and name it as your model name + "_eval.pth", e.g. "UTKFace_eval.pth" with the same path as target model.

### For AttrInf and ModSteal
There are two modes in general, i.e. Partial and Shadow. Users could change the training set in [```main```](./demo.py#L225-L229) function
